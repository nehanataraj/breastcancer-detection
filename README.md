# breastcancer-detection
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to detect malignant vs. benign tumors in breast cancer mammography images.

# More Info
Part of an AP Research project submission. Project aimed to solve a medical equity problem - male breast cancer is rare and understudied, so there's very little data available to train AI detection algorithms specifically for men. The aim was to take existing female breast cancer mammogram datasets and mix in small amounts of male breast cancer images to see if this could create a detection system that works for both genders. The SVM tests different ratios of male-to-female images (1:21, 1:11, etc.) to find a balance where the algorithm performs well on both types of cases. The goal was to provide a practical solution for male breast cancer detection without having to wait for years to collect enough male-specific data, since early detection is crucial for survival outcomes.
